    <h2>Ingredients List</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>2 prime steak cuts (such as ribeye or filet mignon)</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons olive oil</li>
      <li>4 cloves garlic, minced</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon fresh rosemary, chopped</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon fresh thyme leaves</li>
      <li>Salt and freshly ground black pepper, to taste</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Directions</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Remove the prime steak cuts from the refrigerator and let them come to
        room temperature.
      </li>
      <li>
        In a bowl, mix olive oil, minced garlic, chopped rosemary, and fresh
        thyme leaves to create a marinade.
      </li>
      <li>
        Generously season the steaks with salt and freshly ground black pepper
        on both sides.
      </li>
      <li>
        Coat the steaks with the marinade, ensuring they are well covered. Let
        them marinate for about 30 minutes.
      </li>
      <li>Preheat the grill to high heat.</li>
      <li>
        Remove the steaks from the marinade and let excess marinade drip off.
      </li>
      <li>
        Place the steaks on the hot grill and sear for a few minutes on each
        side for the desired level of doneness.
      </li>
      <li>
        Use a meat thermometer to check the internal temperature. For
        medium-rare, aim for around 135°F (57°C).
      </li>
      <li>
        Remove the steaks from the grill and let them rest for a few minutes to
        allow juices to redistribute.
      </li>
      <li>
        Slice and serve the perfectly grilled Michelin star steaks with your
        favorite sides.
      </li>
    </ol>
